# Repository cleanup audit

Inventory for structural cleanup of moonbasic-compiler.  
**Rule:** do not delete unclear/risky files. Prefer moves with `git mv` and path updates.

Date: 2026-07-25  
Branch: `chore/repository-cleanup`  
Baseline: `main` @ post-`8233017`

Legend — **Action:** keep | move | rename | generate | defer | ignore-local  
**Risk:** low | medium | high

## Top-level directories

### `compiler/`

| Field | Value |
|-------|--------|
| Current path | `compiler/` |
| Purpose | Lexer, parser, AST, semantic, codegen, include, builtinmanifest, pipeline |
| References | `main.go`, `cmd/moonbasic`, `lsp/`, `vm/`, tests, CI `--check` |
| Recommended destination | Keep |
| Recommended action | keep |
| Risk level | low |
| Reason | Clear architectural boundary; already well named |
| Validation required | `CGO_ENABLED=0 go test ./compiler/...` |

### `vm/`

| Field | Value |
|-------|--------|
| Current path | `vm/` |
| Purpose | Opcode IR, execution, heap, handlecall bridge |
| References | compiler codegen, runtime, `moonrun` |
| Recommended destination | Keep |
| Recommended action | keep |
| Risk level | low |
| Reason | Bytecode contract lives here |
| Validation required | `go test ./vm/...` |

### `runtime/`

| Field | Value |
|-------|--------|
| Current path | `runtime/` (~65 packages, many `mb*` prefixes) |
| Purpose | Built-in command implementations (graphics, physics, net, data, world, …) |

| Recommended destination | Keep flat for this cleanup series |
| Recommended action | defer domain regroup (`graphics/`, `physics/`, …) |
| Risk level | high (if moved now) |
| Reason | Build tags, CGO/stub splits, registration order; mass moves break CI |

|--------------|---------|-------------------------|--------|------|
| `README.md` | Project front door | root | keep | low |
| `LICENSE` | Licence | root | keep | low |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | Contributor entry | root | keep | low |
| `AGENTS.md` | Agent/contributor notes | root | keep | low |

## Local scratch (do not commit)

| Path | Notes |
|------|--------|
| `*.exe`, `moonbasic.exe`, `moonrun.exe` | `.gitignore` already covers `*.exe` |
| `save.json`, `spin_test.txt`, `_mattest/` | Already ignored |

---

## Duplication

| Item | Canonical | Copy | Action |
|------|-----------|------|--------|
| User docs | `docs/` | `ide/bundled-docs/` (after rename) | generate via `tools/docsexport` |
| API surface | `compiler/builtinmanifest/commands.json` | `docs/api/*`, `docs/API_CONSISTENCY.md` | generate via `tools/apidoc` |
| Command lists | manifest | various audits | prefer generators |

---

## Explicitly deferred (do not do in this series)

1. Regroup `runtime/` into domain folders  
2. Mass `testdata/` / `examples/` taxonomy  
3. Rename `mb*` Go packages  
4. Move root `main.go` into `cmd/`  
5. Delete historical docs without link+history proof  

---

## Planned safe actions (this branch)

1. Add this audit, cleanup log, codebase map  
2. Move root planning docs into `docs/`  
3. Reorganize `scripts/` into subfolders + update references  
4. Rename `moonbasic ide` → `ide`  
5. Add `docsexport --check` + generated marker  
6. Package READMEs + CONTRIBUTING link to codebase map
